# Class-08 Reading Notes

## Learn Flexbox

- Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

  - This means that the container is in rows or columns across the webpage and provides CSS styling independently of each axis.

- Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

  - The main axis is set by the `flex-direction` and can be the row or column. The main axis items move as a group. The cross axis is opposite of what the main axis gets set as and items can be moved as a group or individually. 

- How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

  - Ordering - It can change the visual order of the HTML layout without changing the logical order, which can cause issues with screen readers. 

  - Hidden Content- `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` can make content invisible to screen readers.

## Flexbox Layout

- What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

  - Easier Alignment - `justify-content` and `align-items`
  - Sizing - automatically adjusts size to fit available space
  - Flexible Layouts - allows for one-dimensional layouts
  - No clearing issues
  - Responsiveness
  - Increased simplicity 

- How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

  - This allows for improved efficiency and simplicity as a full stack developer. It will help me create web pages that are responsive, cross-browser compatible, improve UX, improve problem solving, and collaborate with others.
