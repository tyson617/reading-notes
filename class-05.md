## HTML

- What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?<br>

  - Give a description to an image if the browser doesn’t support it<br>
  - Help search engine optimization<br>
  - If a user has images disabled<br>
  - Allow screen reading for the visually impaired<br>

- How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?<br>

  - Utilizing accessible link text if image needs to be a link<br>
  - Be descriptive with `alt` text<br>
  - Use semantic HTML<br>
  - Use high quality images<br>

- Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.<br>

  - A `figure` element is useful when you want to provide a caption to an image.<br>

- Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.<br>

  - A `gif` image stands for graphic interchange format. They’re like a flip book, where a series of pictures are quickly shown and appear like a short clip, but don’t have the best detail.<br>

  - An `svg` image stands for a scalable vector graphic is more like a simple drawing book that uses a variety of lines and shapes to create a picture. This is good for things like icons or logos, which maintain their quality if enlarged.<br>

- What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?<br>

  - A PNG or lossless WebP because they are best at compressing without losing quality, which is especially important if there’s text in the image.<br>
