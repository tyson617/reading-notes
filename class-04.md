# Class-04 Reading Notes

## HTML

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?<br>
  - The `<a>` element is used to create a basic link.<br>
  
- The href attribute contains what information?<br>
  - The `href` attribute contains the actual link, such as the web address, phone number, document fragment, etc.<br>
  
- What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?<br>
  - We can ensure this by using clear link wording, proper semantics, and link styling.<br>

## CSS

- What is meant by “normal flow”?<br>
  - Normal flow refers to the standard layout of a webpage if unchanged by the developer.<br>

- What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?<br>
  - Block-level elements create a block around the parent element and its contents, create line breaks, follow box model styling, allow for its contents to be changed as a whole, and are used for structural components. Inline elements are specific to its individual line of code, only encompass the width and height needed to contain the content, do not create line breaks, and are used for text-level semantics.<br>

- ___ positioning is the default for every html element.<br>
  - Static<br>

- Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.<br>
  - Absolute positioning allows for complex layouts outside of normal flow with improved precision, responsiveness, and layering.<br>

- What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?<br>
  - A key difference is that fixed positioning will always be visible, despite the user scrolling through a webpage.<br>

## JavaScript

- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.<br>
  - A function declaration is identifying a name for a function block, while invocation is the process of calling the declared function and executing it based off the parameters set at declaration.<br>

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?<br>
  - A parameter is a placeholder for the variable that is needed for a function to run and contained within the parentheses. An argument is a value or expression inserted into those placeholders that used when the function is invoked.<br>

## Miscellaneous

- Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
  - Greater efficiency can be a benefit in a variety of ways. I believe working with another individual allows for a project to have improved clarity and cleanliness of code, with less bugs and breaks.
  - Learning from fellow students allows for individual growth with skills and knowledge from a classmate. While self explanatory, this collaboration will help me become a better programmer and see varying perspectives.
