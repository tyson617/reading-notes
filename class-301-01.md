# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

  - What is a “component”?
      - A component is a unit of composition with a specific interface and explicit context. It encapsulates a               functionality that can be exported as a higher level interface.
  - What are the characteristics of a component?
      - Reusability
      - Replaceability
      - Extensible
      - Encapsulated: Allowing caller to use functionality and not expose it's details.
      - Independent: designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
      - Not context specific: designed to operate in different environments or contexts.
  - What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
