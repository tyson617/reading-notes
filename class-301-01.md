# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

  - What is a “component”?
      - A component is a unit of composition with a specific interface and explicit context. It encapsulates a               functionality that can be exported as a higher level interface.
  - What are the characteristics of a component?
      - Reusability
      - Replaceability
      - Extensible: can extend from existing component to provide a new behavior.
      - Encapsulated: allowing caller to use functionality and not expose it's details.
      - Independent: designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
      - Not context specific: designed to operate in different environments or contexts.
  - What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
      - Ease of deployment
      - Reduced cost: using third-party components allows spread of development and maintenance costs.
      - Reusable
      - Modification of technical complexity
      - Reliability
      - System maintenance and evolution: easy to change and update without affecting the rest of the system.
      - Independent


## What is Props and How to Use it in React

- What is “props” short for?
    - Properties
- How are props used in React?
    - Props are used to pass data and values between components.
- What is the flow of props?
    - One-way data flow
        - Data can only be transfered from parent to child components.
        - Data cannot be passed from child to parent.
        - All data passed to child cannot be changed by child.
