## Introduction to Events

- How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
  - An event is similar to any particular action occurring within a home gathering. If the entire home represents the entire code, a person cooking dinner would be similar to an event, being that there are different actions and triggers that are individually happening within the home.

- When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
  - Type of event - button, drop down, etc.
  - Function to be executed when the event happens

- Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
  - An event object stores the details about the event. The target helps to identify what element triggered the event.

- What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
  - Event bubbling is how the browser handles events triggered on a specific element and then to itâ€™s parent element.
  - Event capturing occurs in reverse of event bubbling, meaning the highest ancestor element gets triggered, which then travels to the target element.
