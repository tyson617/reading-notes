# Class-6 Reading Notes

## JavaScript

- How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?<br>

  - An object is like a box with multiple storage compartments inside of it. The compartments are labeled so you can easily access them and use the contents. The object itself acts like the map of the box.<br>

- What are some advantages to creating object literals?<br>

  - Object literal advantages include simplicity, lightweight, and flexibility.<br>

- How do objects differ from arrays?<br>

  - Objects are collections of key-value pairs, or properties, that are unique identifiers. An array is an ordered list.<br>

- Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.<br>

  - Bracket notation is similar to an array, and often referred to as an associative array. An example would be when you want to access a property defined within a variable, such as user information.<br>

- Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?<br>

  - The keyword `this` is referring to the object it’s written within. This can be valuable when you need to create more than one object, allowing for the same definition for each object. In this example, `this` is referring to the defined object `dog` and age of 2.<br>

## DOM

- What is the DOM?<br>

  - DOM stands for document object model and acts as the structure of web documents as a tree-like structure consisting of a root and various nodes within it such as `<p>`, `<body>`, etc. This allows the webpage to communicate with languages like JS in order to make modifications and create an interactive and dynamic environment.<br>

- Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.<br>

  - The DOM acts as a Web API for building websites and it’s the JS that communicates with and modifies the static DOM to create a more dynamic webpage.<br>
