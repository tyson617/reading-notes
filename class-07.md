# Class 07 Reading Notes

## Domain Modeling

- Explain why we need domain modeling<br>
  - Domain modeling helps teams with communication, simplifying, and designing complex problems.<br>

## HTML

- Why should tables not be used for page layouts?<br>

  - Reduced accessibility<br>
  - Produce excessive markup<br>
  - Increases difficulty to write, maintain, and debug<br>
  - Tables aren’t automatically responsive<br>


- List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.<br>

  - Table Data `<td>`
	  - Adds data to table cell
  - Table Row `<tr>`
	  - Creates rows
  - Headers `<th>`
	  - Names the row or column<br>

## Introducing Constructors

- What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

  - A constructor is a function that provides the shell to create object literals. Advantages of instructors are to improve efficiency if multiple objects are needed.

- How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

  - When using an object literal, `this` refers only to its parent object. When used in a constructor it defines the empty properties or methods of the object.

## Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

- Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

  - As a physical therapist, a prototype would be a common exercise template to be used for different patients that are being treated for a similar injury, for example anyone with a leg injury will warm-up on a recumbent bike at the beginning of every session. While inheritance would be like the customizations I make to each program based on the patient’s unique injury, restrictions, tolerance, and goals.
